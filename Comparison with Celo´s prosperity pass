While Basenames shares similarities with Celo’s Prosperity Pass, a smart account wallet using Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) for onchain identity, there are key differences. Prosperity Pass, launched by CeloPG, focuses on non-transferable SBTs for user authentication, credit scores, and community reputation, emphasizing regenerative finance (ReFi) and financial inclusion. Basenames, conversely, prioritizes transferable ENS-based subdomains for simplified transactions and cross-chain compatibility, aligning with Base’s goal of mainstream Web3 adoption. Both initiatives enhance onchain identity but cater to distinct use cases within their respective ecosystems.

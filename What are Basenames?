Basenames is a native naming service on the Base blockchain, designed to map complex wallet addresses to human-readable names, similar to how domain names simplify IP addresses on the internet. By registering a Basename (e.g., “bob.base.eth”), users can replace cumbersome hexadecimal addresses with intuitive identifiers, making it easier to send and receive funds, connect with dApps, and establish a verifiable onchain identity. Built on ENS’s decentralized architecture, Basenames operates entirely onchain, ensuring security, transparency, and interoperability across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains.Introduced by Base, a Layer 2 solution powered by Optimism’s OP Stack, Basenames supports Coinbase’s vision of onboarding the next billion users to Web3. The service integrates with Base’s ecosystem, including tools like OnchainKit and platforms like OpenSea, and has driven significant adoption, with Base reporting a record 1.05 million daily active users in August 2024, partly fueled by Basenames’ popularity.

Basenames faces challenges, such as ensuring user education about onchain data privacy, as all published information is recorded onchain. Base advises users not to share sensitive data and provides clear Profile Management tools to mitigate risks. Additionally, while single-address linking is currently supported, Base plans to enable multi-address linking to enhance flexibility.

Looking ahead, Base aims to expand Basenamesâ€™ utility by:Adding Discounts: Collaborating with projects to offer more promotional discounts, increasing accessibility.

Enhancing Integrations: Encouraging developers to integrate Basenames into new dApps, leveraging OnchainKit for features like badges and custom functionalities.

Supporting AI and Data Sovereignty: Projects like Basenames.AI are exploring how Basenames can serve as a foundation for permissionless data spaces, enabling users to control and monetize their data with AI agents.

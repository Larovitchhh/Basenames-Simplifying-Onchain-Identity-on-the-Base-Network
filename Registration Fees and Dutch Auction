At launch, Basenames implements a Dutch auction to prevent bots and ensure fair distribution. The auction starts with a premium of 100 ETH, decaying exponentially over 36 hours. If a name is not renewed after the 90-day grace period, it enters a 21-day Dutch auction starting at 100 ETH, ensuring equitable access to high-demand names.
